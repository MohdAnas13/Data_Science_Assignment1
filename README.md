Employee Management System (EMS)
üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to create a simplified Employee Management System (EMS) using Python.
This project demonstrates the use of:

Control structures (if-else, loops)

Functions for modular design

Dictionary data structures for storing employee data

Basic object-oriented concepts in a structured program

üõ† Steps to Implement
Step 1 ‚Äì Data Storage

Used a dictionary to store employee data.

The key is the emp_id (Employee ID).

The value is another dictionary containing:

name: Employee‚Äôs name

age: Employee‚Äôs age

department: Employee‚Äôs department

salary: Employee‚Äôs monthly salary

‚úÖ Example:

employees = {
    101: {'name': 'Basidh', 'age': 27, 'department': 'HR', 'salary': 50000},
    102: {'name': 'Anas', 'age': 22, 'department': 'IT', 'salary': 60000},
    103: {'name': 'Ashiq', 'age': 25, 'department': 'Finance', 'salary': 55000}
}

Step 2 ‚Äì Menu System

A menu is displayed continuously until the user chooses Exit. Options include:

Add Employee

View All Employees

Search Employee

Exit

Step 3 ‚Äì Add Employee

Prompts the user for Employee ID, Name, Age, Department, and Salary.

Validates if the Employee ID is unique.

Stores the data in the dictionary.

Step 4 ‚Äì View All Employees

Displays all employees in a table-like format.

If no employees exist, it shows "No employees available.".

Step 5 ‚Äì Search Employee by ID

Prompts the user for an Employee ID.

If the ID exists, displays full details.

Otherwise, shows "Employee not found.".

Step 6 ‚Äì Exit

Provides an Exit option in the menu.

Displays a thank-you message before ending the program.

üìÇ Project Code Structure

main_menu() ‚Üí Displays the menu & calls functions

add_employee() ‚Üí Adds a new employee

view_employees() ‚Üí Displays all employees

search_employee() ‚Üí Searches employee by ID

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Save the project file as ems.py.

Open a terminal/command prompt.
